Purposes of this report 
The purpose of this report is to describe how I think that the school can spend money in my school. 
I think that money can be used to improve education, like building a library in my school. 
I believe that school should have a space where students be able to read a book or study during the afternoon. 
So many times i spend the afternoon in the school for some project and to do an exam and sometime I havenâ€™t place to study for the exam or pass my free time before the courses. 
What the school should do 
I think in the school should be a space to study and stay when someone have a spare time. 
So i will talk about this and i will show the project to build a library. 
Another thing is to share books with other students like novels that school buy and students can use, like a private library.
Recommandation 
I recommend that school don't use this money to do something that students don't need. 
To avoid this i think that school should do a meeting where students explain them project and all together discuss the topic.
